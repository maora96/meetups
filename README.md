this is a tutorial project based on the video by [Academind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFuwkrseXVE&t=13s). this was my first attempt at creating a project with next.js instead of create-react-app. you can find it online [here](https://meetups-elzodkg6g-maora96.vercel.app).

## technologies

- nextjs
- mongodb

## dependencies

- react
- react-dom
- mongodb
- next

## start project

```bash
# clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/maora96/meetups.git

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# run app in development mode
$ npm run dev

# create production build
$ npm run build
```
